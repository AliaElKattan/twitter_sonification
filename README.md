# Four: A Twitter Sonification
Sonification of my twitter data from 2011-2014 (Python ---> Max MSP) 

Going to a Kaki King show at the NYUAD Arts Center made me fascinated with the idea of using data to tell your own story. I decided to use the archive of my tweets and explore what my own story has been, starting in 2011, the year I joined Twitter and the Arab Spring started in Egypt. (oh well, won't debate the name now)

I did some cleaning and analysis of the data (my Twitter archive) in Python/pandas, sent the output to .txt files, and sent them to a Max 8 patch. Feel free to look through the files above for a better follow through!
